/**
 * Run the better-auth pipeline inside the tenant bound to the request's branded
 * domain, so end-customer sign-in / sign-up / reset / verification resolve users
 * within that reseller's tenant (or the platform when no custom domain matches).
 *
 * The reseller that owns a custom domain can also sign in on that domain: when a
 * scoped lookup misses, the adapter falls back to the tenant owner (`Tenant.ownerId`,
 * root-tenant row only). So a reseller signs into the builder on both the platform URL and
 * their own domain; their sub-accounts only on the reseller's domain. This
 * fallback applies to every auth method, including OAuth social sign-in — see
 * the findOne reseller-owner fallback in `@chatbotx.io/auth` `server.ts`.
 *
 * OAuth still needs special tenant recovery: the provider redirects to a
 * redirect URI pinned per-credential (the reseller's own active custom domain
 * for a tenant-owned credential, else the broker host —
 * `NEXT_PUBLIC_BROKER_URL`, defaulting to the builder URL; see
 * `auth-instances.ts`), so on the `/callback/*` leg `x-domain` may not match
 * where the flow started. There we recover the tenant from the persisted
 * OAuth `state` instead — its `callbackURL` carries the originating reseller
 * origin. Without this, a social signup on a reseller domain would be created
 * in the root tenant. See `resolveTenantFromOAuthState`.
 *
 * Two further white-label concerns are handled here:
 *
 * 1. Relay — the registered callback host can differ from the *originating*
 *    branded host (inherited/platform credentials always land on the broker;
 *    a tenant-owned credential lands on the reseller's own domain even when
 *    the flow started on the platform host). Landing anywhere but the
 *    originating host mints the session cookie somewhere the user isn't, so
 *    on the `/callback/*` leg we bounce the callback (same code + state) back
 *    to that host before handling. Mirrors the Facebook/TikTok relay in
 *    `integrations/[...integration]`.
 *
 * 2. Per-tenant social apps — better-auth freezes social-provider config at init,
 *    so we dispatch the social/callback legs to a per-credential auth instance
 *    resolved for the bound tenant and provider (own app, else platform default).
 *    Every other route uses the default `auth` instance. See `auth-instances.ts`.
 *
 * 3. Verification redirect re-homing — better-auth resolves the post-verification
 *    redirect (magic-link/verify, verify-email, reset-password) against its fixed
 *    `baseURL` (the builder URL), so a user who clicked the link on a branded
 *    domain would be bounced to the builder host — losing the brand and the
 *    host-scoped session cookie just minted. We rewrite that redirect back onto
 *    the originating host. See `rewriteAuthRedirectToPublicHost`.
