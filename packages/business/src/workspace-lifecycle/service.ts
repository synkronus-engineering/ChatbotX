/**
 * High-volume tables that carry a direct `workspaceId` FK, ordered
 * children-before-parents so each batched delete respects referential
 * integrity on its own (independent of the deferred cascade). A workspace can
 * hold millions of messages/contacts; deleting them via the single
 * `DELETE FROM "Workspace"` FK cascade would scan every child table inside one
 * transaction, holding locks and bloating WAL. Instead we drain these tables
 * in small `ctid`-bounded chunks — one short autocommit statement each — and
 * leave the remaining low-volume tables to the final cascade.
 *
 * Table names are the physical PG identifiers (not Drizzle models) because the
 * delete is a raw `ctid IN (... LIMIT ...)` statement the query builder cannot
 * express; keep them in sync with the schema if a table is renamed.
 *
 * `Message` and `Attachment` are deliberately NOT here: they are compressed
 * TimescaleDB hypertables where `ctid` is unavailable ("transparent
 * decompression only supports tableoid system column"). They are drained
 * separately by `deleteWorkspaceHypertableRows`, which deletes by the
 * `conversationId` segmentby column with the decompression cap lifted — the
 * same technique as `messageCleanupService.purgeRow`.
